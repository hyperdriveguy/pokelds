# Pokémon LDS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hyperdriveguy/pokelds.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hyperdriveguy/pokelds)

Hack based on the disassembly of Pokémon Crystal.  
Currently just a concept. Some of the first few maps have been done.  
See TODO.md for what still needs to be done (if you're not afraid of spoilers).
  
To build, see INSTALL.md
