# Pokémon Crystal 20XX

This hack aims to modernize Pokemon Crystal with the following changes made thus far:
-Modern EV/IV system
-Fairy type added (updated gen 1/2 pokemon and moves to reflect this)
-Type matchup updated to reflect gen 6+
-Pokemon's ID in base stats increased to 2 bytes
-Physical/Special Split
-Moves updated to gen 6 accuracy/power/pp
-Some moves have unchanged power or effects, like low kick and roar, however accuracy reflects 6 gen's
-Accuracy/Evasion checks should now be calculated like Gen 3 and onward.
-Stat stage modifiers now reflect gen 3+ too. (minor difference)
-Added music for shops, nugget bridge, cerulean city, and cinnabar island
-Extended the Kanto trainer theme
-Gen 6 base stats
-Natures!
-Pokemon now have a 1 in 4096 chance of being shiny (like gen 6)
-Stat screen shows what stats are modified by natures
-Icons show if a move is Physical, Special, or Status
-Run by holding B. This is faster than walking, but slower than biking. (thanks to VictoriaLacroix for their running code I borrowed and modified)
