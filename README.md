# Pokémon Crystal 20XX

This hack aims to modernize Pokemon Crystal with the following changes made thus far:

* Modern EV/IV system

* Fairy type added (updated gen 1/2 pokemon and moves to reflect this)

* Type matchup updated to reflect gen 6+

* Pokemon's ID in base stats increased to 2 bytes

* Physical/Special Split

* Moves updated to gen 6 accuracy/power/pp

* Some moves have unchanged power or effects, like low kick and roar, however accuracy reflects 6 gen's

* Accuracy/Evasion checks should now be calculated like Gen 3 and onward.

* Stat stage modifiers now reflect gen 3+ too. (minor difference)

* Added music for shops, nugget bridge, cerulean city, and cinnabar island

* Extended the Kanto trainer theme

* Gen 6 base stats

* Natures!

* Pokemon now have a 1 in 4096 chance of being shiny (like gen 6)

* Stat screen shows what stats are modified by natures

* Icons show if a move is Physical, Special, or Status

* Run by holding B. This is faster than walking, but slower than biking. (thanks to VictoriaLacroix for their running code I borrowed and modified)
