# Pokémon LDS Code of Conduct

The purpose of this code is to prevent conflict between developers and set
the behavioral standard for development.

This Conduct Applies to anything associated with and endorsed by the Pokémon
LDS project. This includes the offical IRC channel (when we get one), Issues
and Pull Requests on Github. It is preferred on forums related to the project,
but it cannot be as strictly enforced there.

## Social Conduct

Social interactions should be positive in the Pokémon LDS project.

> Perceptions and assumptions can be very dangerous and unfair...Surely
> good neighbors should put forth every effort to understand each other and to
> be kind to one another regardless of religion, nationality, race, or culture.
>
> M. Russell Ballard, [The Doctrine of Inclusion](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion?lang=eng)

Do your best to be fair and kind to one another. Try to understand where the
other person is coming from. Flamewars and trolling are prohibited.

## Language

Language should be uplifting and clean. Refrain from swearing in the community
issues, pull requests, code comments, and especially map text.

> Speak kindly and positively about others. Choose not to insult others or put
> them down, even in joking...Avoid speaking in anger. When you are tempted to
> say harsh or hurtful things, leave them unsaid.

## Dealing with Conflict

* Don't feed the troll.
* Speak gently
* Contact a [Moderator](#moderators)
* Moderators will deal with the conflict accordingly.

## Violations to the Code of Conduct

Violating the Code of Conduct reduces your ability to contribute, and it prevents
you from being able to become a core developer. Core Developers who violate the
Code of Conduct will be given **three warnings**. After they have had three
warnings, the head of the team ([@hyperdriveguy](https://github.com/hyperdriveguy))
will remove them as a core developer.

### Recovery From a Violation

You are still able to contribute, even if you have been removed as a core developer.
However, they will be very carefully observed (Specifically for CoC violations in
the code, along with code quality) by a core developer before the contribution is
accepted. You can ask to become a core developer again after three months have passed.
However, your likelihood of being reaccepted in less probable because of previous
violations.

## Changes to This Code

Anyone is welcome to make changes to this Code of Conduct and make a pull request.
It must be approved by **all core developers** for changes to take effect.
Notifications must be made on all community pages as well.
