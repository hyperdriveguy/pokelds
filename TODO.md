## Bugs

- [ ] The Town Map still uses Johto's layout, rather than the new region's layout.
- [ ] Burn/Poison/Paralyze don't improve catch rate.
- [ ] Experience underflow at level 1.
- [ ] HP bar does not lower at the same speed for high HP.
See the [Issues](issues/) page for things not listed here.  
As far as I know, it also inherits all the bugs not listed here from vanilla Pokémon Crystal.
